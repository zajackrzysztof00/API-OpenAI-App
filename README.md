How to Use the AI-Powered HTML Article Generator
Follow the steps below to easily generate structured HTML content from your articles:

1. Add Custom Prompts (Optional):
Use the text input field at the top to specify custom instructions for formatting the HTML. For example:
"Use for main sections."
"Add image captions with descriptions."
Click the "Submit" button to add your prompt to the list.
If you make a mistake or want to adjust your prompts:
Select a prompt and click "Delete Selected Prompt" to remove it.
Use "Clear All Prompts" to reset the prompt list.
2. Load Your Article:
Click the "Article content" button to open a file dialog.
Select the .txt file containing the article you want to convert into HTML.
The application uses this content as the basis for HTML generation.
3. Generate the HTML:
Once your prompts (if any) and article file are ready, click "Make Article HTML":
The application will start formatting the article into HTML based on your prompts and the content of the article.
A progress notification will be displayed when the process begins.
4. Review the Results:
After completion, the application automatically saves the generated HTML to a default file named artykul.html or your specified file path.
Youâ€™ll see a confirmation message: "HTML Generation Ended."
Tips:
Make sure your .txt article file is well-organized for better HTML results.
If you want to start over, you can clear all prompts and reload a different article.
Error Handling:
If no prompts are added, the application will use default instructions for generating HTML.
If the OpenAI API key file (key.txt) is missing or invalid, an error will be displayed, and the application will not run.
This simple workflow ensures that you can create clean, structured HTML content from your articles quickly and efficiently.
